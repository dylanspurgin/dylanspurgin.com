    <h3>WordPress</h3>
    <p>I use WordPress often to develop sites for clients that need a marketing site that looks great and is easy for the team to make changes to.</p>
    <p>I have been building sites for the platform for over 10 years. WordPress makes it easy to get started quickly by choosing a theme you like and customizing it to fit your brand. If you need something truly unique then custom themes and plugins are always an option.</p>

    <h3>Angular</h3>
    <p>I have lead development efforts on a number of different Angular applications. I have built a product-aware video management system, as well as end-user, provider, and administrator service management applications.</p>

    <h3>Ionic</h3>
    <p>Ionic is a platform for developing mobile applications based on AngularJs that work on both Android and iOS devices.</p>
    <p>Ionic is a good choice for proof of concept and early stage start up mobile apps.</p>

    <h3>Vue</h3>
    <p>Vue.js is a fairly new front-end application platform that is similar to Angular or React. It is gaining popularity due to its low barrier to entry for new developers. dylanspurgin.com is built on Vue!</p>
